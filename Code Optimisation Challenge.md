# Programming Challenge

At Careview we use entity framework quite a lot. While Entity framework is a great tool to work with databases, it can surprise you if you are not careful with what you are doing. The console applicaiton in this folder contains has some not so optimised Entity Framework code

You are tasked with optimising the entity framework queries
Your Implementation should

- Be highly performant
- should produce the best possible SQL Queries
- Should not use stored procedures
- Be reusable and testable
- Have tests, as you would for production code


The solution should be to a standard you are proud of, ready for the-interview

### Questions and Assumptions

While you are completing the exercise, you may encounter some questions or impediments. Rather than being blocked, please make assumptions based on what you think is the best approach. Also, make a note of these assumptions to help as we explore the solution together.

### Ideas and Improvements

While you are completing the exercise you may come up with some ideas for enhancements. Make a note of them, and come prepared to have a brief discussion with us about them.

## The Interview

During the interview, we will explore the implementation you've developed to solve the problem. We'll then introduce a new scenario to consider, and extend your solution to cater for it.
